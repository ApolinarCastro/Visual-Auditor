# Visual Auditor

Evidence-first marketplace observation and intelligence project.

## Current state — 2026-09-29

Current focus: MRI autonomous marketplace intelligence across four marketplaces:
- Mercado Libre
- Paris
- Falabella
- Ripley

### Latest milestones

- MRI-AUTONOMY-006: Ripley facet application reported PASS in a fresh MRI-only run after the `page_signature` fix.
- MRI-AUTONOMY-007: controlled propagation reported PASS across 3 direct Ripley children, with no code changes and no AutoClaw/manual actions.
- MRI-4MARKETPLACES-BASELINE-001: bounded cross-marketplace baseline completed. First blockers identified across all marketplaces.
- MRI-CROSSMARKET-BLOCKERS-001: forensic root cause resolution completed across all blockers:
  - Mercado Libre: root cause evidenced (evaluator missing key `brand_evidence_count_text` + address URL false capture + store sidebar facet adapter gap).
  - Paris: root cause evidenced (Next.js App Router streaming RSC `self.__next_f` state vs null `__NEXT_DATA__` + DOM Mega-Menu noise pollution).
  - Comparison ML ↔ Paris: strictly proven as `ML_PARIS_SAME_MECHANISM = NO` (zero shared architecture; shared symptom only).
  - Falabella ENTRY: conclusively classified as `CHALLENGE_PAGE` (Cloudflare WAF HTTP 403 challenge interstitial in headless Playwright).
  - Runner rc=1: conclusively classified as `WRAPPER_FAILURE` (NameError at `baseline_4mp.py:97`, MRI pipeline unaffected).
  - Governed execution: code changes = 0, AutoClaw = 0, manual = 0, Ripley actions = 0.

## Current operating decision

Do not continue expanding Ripley's large frontier merely because the mechanism works. Use the four-marketplace capability matrix and the specific root causes demonstrated in `MRI-CROSSMARKET-BLOCKERS-001` to drive the smallest next implementation fix under strict governance.

## Core principles

- Input is `marketplace + brand`, not hardcoded answers.
- `SOURCE_BLOCKED != NOT_FOUND`.
- `PUBLICADO != VISIBLE`.
- Deterministic evidence/verification governs truth; AI is bounded investigation/strategy support.
- AutoClaw is diagnostic/teaching support only.
- No synthetic truth, hardcoded result counts, Cartesian category assignment, or self-certified metrics.
- Independent verification must reconcile reported results from persisted evidence.
- VA/Legacy remains protected unless explicitly authorized.

## Repository scope note

This GitHub repository stores the persistent project state and verified forensic artifacts.

## Next task

Select the smallest actionable fix identified in MRI-CROSSMARKET-BLOCKERS-001 under strict governance: either (A) fix the runner wrapper / emission key, (B) implement ML store sidebar facet discovery, or (C) implement Paris Next.js App Router RSC facet parser. Do not attempt Falabella bypass without explicit governance authorization.
